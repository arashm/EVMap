EVMap is a simple PWA that shows EV charger locations in Berlin, in a map. The app leverages service workers to provide
some of the functionality offline. As you load the map and move around it, the app will cache the map tiles you have
loaded to be used when offline. Search functionality is not available when offline.

Users can enter a simple address in Berlin (like `LÃ¼tzowufer 15`) and get up to 3 closest charging stations around the location.

# Setting up

The app requires Ruby `3.2.2`. To setup the app after running `bundle install` to install the required gems, run:

```shell
bundle exec rails db:setup
```

Then run the app using `./bin/dev`.
